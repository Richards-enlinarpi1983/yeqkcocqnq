Whoa. Just wow. Totally didn’t expect to be thrown into a whirlwind like that. My head’s still spinning... from the movie or the theater’s seat that’s harder than a miser’s heart, I dunno. Deva, yeah? It's like if a dream tried to sit you down for coffee and explain why jellyfish don't wear hats. First half?.?. I think I had popcorn stuck between my teeth but was too mesmerized to care. The colors were... like a 𝘗𝘦𝘢𝘤𝘰𝘤𝘬 exploded in a kaleidoscope. Total sensory overload, but in a way that made my eyeballs feel alive.

> Deva... She's a character I’ll be trying to make sense of for days. Imagine someone bottling up lightning and then, whoops, the lightning learns ballet. That's her. It's like, you're in a noisy, jam-packed train and somehow you can only hear her voice, clear as a bell with thunder in the background.

The soundtrack. Man, it danced around my head like bees at a wedding. Like, one moment I'm hearing violins weep, and the next, it's like the drums are trying to start a revolution in my heart. Suddenly remembered someone asking if they could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the movie. Dude, if the magic of it can fit into a 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥, I’d be amazed. But seriously, see it in the theater ‘cause... the experience surrounds you like a bearhug from a rainbow.

Scenes kept bleeding into one another, like my mind was on a merry-go-round missing half the horses. One second I’m 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Deva in a huge field of... pianos? I think? Then bam, she’s in the city dodging reality like it’s a pesky fly. Yeah, I remember the narrator saying something profound but I was too busy picking crumbs off my lap. It’s like mixing metaphors until they make soup. And soup that dances with you until 3 AM.

Oh! Don’t 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the movie with a full bladder. Seriously. Action and heartfelt moments blend like milk spilled into tea. No pauses, no breathers. Just one wave after another. I think my back will take a day to forgive me for slouching through it all.

if(true) { return false; } // Why is this here???

Hehe, just a reminder. Maybe I need sleep. Or coffee. Or both.
